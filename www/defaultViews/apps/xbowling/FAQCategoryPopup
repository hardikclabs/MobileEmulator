We are working hard to get more centers signed up as quickly as possible!  If your center does not support XBowling, please contact them and tell them "I want my XBowling."  While you may not be able to XBowl in your center at this point, you can still use the XBowling App to see Live Scores of your friends and other XBowlers in other centers around the world, access XBowling and Industry News, view play at major tournaments, and check out XBowling Leaderboards.</p>
                    <p>But the best news?  We will soon introduce the capability for XBowling users to manually enter their scores in the App so everyone can enjoy the thrill of XBowling at any location!</p>

                    <p>We have integrated our software with the scoring systems of many bowling centers in the US and around the world to allow our system to keep track of every ball throw and game at every XBowling-enabled center.   Such integration involves the placement of some XBowling equipment directly in bowling centers.</p>
                    <p>As of October 2013, we have captured nearly 1 billion ball throws around the world!  Such integrations continue every month, as more and more centers learn about this new technology and become XBowling-enabled.</p>
                    <p>This ball throw and game information that we track is stored by us in the cloud (secure data center managed by companies such as Microsoft and Amazon), and we provide access to it in real time via the wireless internet to XBowlers on their smartphone or tablet devices.</p>
                    <p>By providing this data for live games or games previously bowled, we enable XBowlers to bowl against a single or multiple opponents regardless of where they are physically located and when they are actually bowling!   For example, if you bowl and post your completed game, your friend (or complete stranger) can find your game in our App and play against that game - and as they bowl each frame, your score will be revealed to them also frame by frame - so they get a sense of a live game!</p>
                    <p>By logging on to our website at www.xbowling.com, anyone can also see all XBowling-enabled centers in the world, find a player they want to follow (XBowler or not), and see the scores of their most recently completed game or follow along frame by frame as they bowl.  This Live Score functionality is also available within our App in the Live Scores Tile.</p>

                    <p>While bowling, use your credits to enter Challenges.  When you win Challenges, you win Points, which also turn into SCN Reward Points at a 1:1 ratio.  SCN Reward Points are then redeemed for prizes in our SCN Rewards Store.</p>
                    <p>Redeeming prizes is simple.  Select the prizes you would like to receive, enter your address, and for no additional charge we will ship directly to your location.</p>
                    <p><u>For iOS:</u> You can get to our SCN Rewards Store by clicking "Get Prizes" button on our Home Screen or Main Game Screen.</p>
                    <p><u>For Android:</u> As of this time, Android does not offer guidance as to whether XBowling complies with its policies on skill-based games.  Until such time that Google establishes or clarifies such policies,  we are not able to offer in app redemption of prizes.  As such, to redeem prizes, you can get to the SCN Rewards Store online at: www.xbowling.com.</p>

                    <p>XBowling awards and displays 3 types of points:</p>
                    <p>Game Points: The number of points won in each frame (in case of XBowl Mania Challenge) or upon completing a game and winning a Challenge.</p>
                    <p>All Time Points: The cumulative number of points ever earned by an XBowler with our App.  This number increases as the Game Point meter increments.  This number is the one used to determine standings on leaderboards that measure points.</p>
                    <p>SCN Reward Point:  Upon the issuance of All Time Points, such points equal 1:1 to the number of SCN Reward Points awarded to the user.  Upon the use of these points to redeem for prizes, the total number decreases by the number of points used in a particular redemption transaction.  The decrease in SCN Reward Points does not cause any corresponding decrease to All Time Points so that the process of redemption for prizes does not adversely affect XBowlers' point leaderboard standing.</p>

                    <p>XBowling uses the handicap system to determine winners of Head to Head Challenges in line with the rules of the USBC, the official governing body of the sport of bowling in the US.   Each player's handicap is determined by the following formula:  (210 - Player's Average) X 90%.  If the organizer/host of a Live Head to Head Challenge wants to set up a game to be scored without handicaps, called "Scratch" game.</p>
                    <p>With XBowling, we use the player's XBowling Average to determine the handicap and a person's average is determined after first 3 XBowled games.  Until a new XBowler plays 3 games, his average is not established and his handicap is shown as zero.</p>
                    <p>For scoring a bowling game between players with different averages/handicaps, one would add each person's handicap to their score (called "gross" or "raw" score) to get their handicapped scores - the highest handicapped score wins.</p>

                    <p>For the updated version of XBowling, we will be converting the points accumulated in the old app ("old points") to new points to ensure that the value of the new points in the SCN Reward Store is identical for customers who accumulated old points in the old app and new XBowlers using the current version of XBowling.  The conversion factor is 100 - each 100 old points will be converted to 1 new point.  </p>
                    <p>Each new point is counted as part of All Time Points, which is a cumulative number for all points cored by an XBowler in our App.  This number is used for calculating point leaderboard status.  In addition, the number of All Time Points will equal the number of of SCN Reward Points used for redemption for prizes in the SCN Reward Store.  As you redeem SCN Reward Points, your total SCN Reward Points go down by the amount redeemed.  However, redemption does not affect the number of All Time Points, so redemptions for prizes do not affect your leaderboard standings!</p>
